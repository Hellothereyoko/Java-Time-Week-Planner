# $${\color{red}Welcome} {} {\color{red}!}$$

<br>  



A week at a glance planner that is completely offline. I've had issues with getting distracted by internet calendars; So I built my own in homeage to DOS! This is the very first version of the program, so please excuse the mess. 

<br>

<br>

## $${\color{red}The} {} {\color{red}Program}$$

<br>
This was made completely from scratch to practice my debugging & program documentation skills in class. Be sure to check out the README pdf for detailed information. This repo is gonna have a changelog attached later, but for now please give Java-Time a try. I hope you enjoy it! <3
